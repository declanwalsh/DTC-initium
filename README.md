Matlab Control of Measurement Specialties DTC Initium Pressure Sensors
Author: Declan Walsh

This is a library of functions designed to interface with the DTC Initium pressure sensor (connected to ESP pressure scanner and 9IFC) over ethernet.
The goal of the library is to provide a high level interface with the pressure sensor and allow users to easily write programs in Matlab using its abilities.
